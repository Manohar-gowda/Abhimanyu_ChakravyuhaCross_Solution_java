//test case : 1
// when i run the code it asks for array of integers synonym of enemies surrounded by circle of 11.
// then the power 
// then the skips abhimanyu had
// then recharge by him

//----->>>>>
//enemypower[] = {1 3 2 4 3 6 5 4 5 4 7}
//p0wer = 9
// a = 5
// b = 3 

//this will returns us "he can cross the circlevyuha".

//test case:2
//[] = {2 4 6 8 22 4 5 8 5 4 14}
// power = 5
// a = 4
// b  =2

//this returns us "Abhimanyu cannot cross Circlevyuha"

//Because he has less power and also he cannot get enough recharge and skips
//Thank you this tests are conducted by manohar gowda (Kodnest Intern (Java Full Stack))
